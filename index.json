Now, let’s understand the basics of a hugo website, so we can start blogging right away! The folder structure of a blank Hugo project looks like this: blog_bubu/ ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── config.toml ├── content/ │ ├── post1.md │ └── post2.md ├── data/ ├── layouts/ ├── public/ ├── static/ └── themes/ config.toml is the brain of the blog, where we will set the title of the website, enable the features we want to use, our social URLs and so on; content is the folder that will contain the posts or pages we write in Markdown, and that will be rendered in HTML; themes is the folder in which we will download the theme we like, or you can create a completely custom theme with time and knowledge available; layouts is a folder used to override the files used in the theme previously picked. Like in Jekyll, you have your (my) maybe-it-can-work customization away from a working theme, and you can go back simply deleting its content. public is the folder with the rendered HTML files. There is a ton more about Hugo that you can find in the documentation), but I am a huge fan of Pareto principle: 80% consequences from 20% causes. I used to read too much the documentation of software I needed to use, but I realized I often lost the focus on what was important: using the software rather than knowing the software. So, my new mantra while approaching new things is to have a mental framework on how things are supposed to work, learn the (not-so-)bare minimum of what is necessary and start doing. Once I need more advanced features, I go back to the documentation and improve/modify my previous knowledge. This is particularly true in this project: I want a functional blog, without super-fancy things. But, as you will see later, I decided to add functionalities that required a bit of search. The last piece of theoretical framework we need is how to organize our workspace. We will need two repositories: our main folder blog_bubu with drafts and configs, and the public folder as a separate submodule. Including the repository of the theme, we will keep track of these three folders: blog_bubu/ # our main folder called MAIN_REPO │ .. ├── public/ # our submodule called PUBLIC_REPO └── themes/ # external submodule THEME_REPO Now, let’s build our first MVB, Minimum Viable Blog!

First we need to create our main folder: hugo new site \u003csite_folder\u003e Inside \u003csite_folder\u003e you should find the following structure: . ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── config.toml ├── content/ ├── data/ ├── layouts/ ├── static/ └── themes/ Now let’s link our private repository with the remote repository: # we are inside \u003csite_folder\u003e git init git remote add origin \u003cMAIN_REPO\u003e.git git add . git commit -m \"initialized repo\" git push -u origin master We add the theme now, in my case: git submodule add https://github.com/upagge/uBlogger.git themes/uBlogger and finally, we can render our website with hugo server -D and check the output in a browser at the address localhost:1313. At the moment it is empty. We need to add at least two more things: Edit the config.toml Add a new post For the configuration file I started with the theoretical minimum: baseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR_USERNAME\u003e.github.io\" # [en, zh-cn, fr, ...] determines default content language defaultContentLanguage = \"en\" # language code languageCode = \"en\" title = \"Blog Bubu\" # Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo theme = \"uBlogger\" [params] # uBlogger theme version version = \"2.0.X\" [menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \"posts\" # you can add extra information before the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons pre = \"\" # you can add extra information after the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons post = \"\" name = \"Posts\" url = \"/posts/\" # title will be shown when you hover on this menu link title = \"\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"about\" pre = \"\" post = \"\" name = \"About\" url = \"/About/\" title = \"\" weight = 2 # Markup related configuration in Hugo [markup] # Syntax Highlighting (https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting) [markup.highlight] # false is a necessary configuration noClasses = false For the new post, you can use: hugo new posts/test.md that will create a file .md in content/posts/ named test.md with this content: --- title: \"Lol\" date: 2021-06-28T22:18:01+02:00 draft: true --- Of course, you can create the same file in any other way and it works just fine. You add your content and the you are ready to publish it on GitHub. How? First you add the PUBLIC_REPO as submodule: git submodule add -b main \u003cPUBLIC_REPO\u003e.git public (I am assuming that the repo bubu.github.io has as protected branch main and not master and has at least 1 commit). Once also this repo is set up, Ryan Schachte has the solution for deploying the website: #!/bin/sh # If a command fails then the deploy stops set -e printf \"\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\\033[0m\\n\" # Build the project. hugo -t uBlogger # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t \u003cYOURTHEME\u003e` # Go To Public folder cd public # Add changes to git. git add . # Commit changes. msg=\"rebuilding site $(date)\" if [ -n \"$*\" ]; then msg=\"$*\" fi git commit -m \"$msg\" # Push source and build repos. git push origin main But, J.!

I guess it is because this posts are actually pages for hugo. In any case, the solution was quite easy at the end. We can exploit the overriding feature of the layouts folder. I just copied the index.html file from the theme with cp theme/uBlogger/layout/index.html layouts/index.html and added the .Reverse instruction to the range $pages.Pages in the {{- /* Posts */ -}} section: {{- range $pages.Pages.Reverse -}} Important EDITAfter publishing this post I realised I made a mistake. By default, hugo orders posts in descending order, but it has to know that your page is actually a post. To do so, in the header of the post you add: --- weight: 1 title: .... since weight = 1 is what you set in the config.toml. Of course, you have to undo the addition of .Reverse.

Does it mean there are other versions of this thing?” I am glad you are so interested, dear reader! “Not really… But, please, continue…” In 2018 I started my first website as a way to store and present the materials for the practical lessons I was teaching at my university. I needed something pleasing for the eye, but not so fancy. I had 0 expertise in HTML and JavaScript, and paying something was not an option worth considering at that time. I resorted to the RTFM approach in the era of Internet, JFGI. One possible (free) option was to use a static site generator and to host the actual site on GitHub. There I was, using Jekyll for my static website, with some CSS custom modifications. The university course ended, and so the posting of new tutorials. No modifications since then. At the end of 2020, I decided to start publishing content there and change the theme, but it was a bit painful. I thought it was muuuuch easier! (I had to reinstall Ruby, other dependecies, fix outdated versions of some packages, etc…) So I decided to switch to HUGO and here we are.

And the writer, Victor Hugo, comes second!!! O tempora, o mores! What I actually wanted is this: a framework for building websites. It is written in Go, a language I know nothing about (as I had no clue for Jekyll written in Ruby). At the moment, the workflow for building this website with Hugo looks quite straightforward: create a new post render it with hugo serve -D if it is ok, you create the html version with hugo -t \u003cyour_theme\u003e you publish it as it is on the platform of your choice. but I will leave the details of the workflow for another post.

It’s interesting, I promise!). But, for my personal site, I switched. Here the key differences I found in this short time: While installing Jekyll, I always ran into some annoyances. With Hugo, I have just installed go and hugo itself with two command lines and I am good to go (no pun intended, lol). For Jekyll I have to write a GitHub Actions to deploy the website, or something similar. For sure, you have the templates available, but if something can go wrong, it usually does. To deploy now, I just have to push the folder with the build. The remote server has to build a container, install the necessary packages and build the site. And it takes some minutes, even for small website. The changes are almost instantaneous. Of course, I found these differences once I started searching info for this new blog. “Ok, I see. But why TWO blogs?!?!” Uhm. Honestly, I did not like the theme I chose with Jekyll, and I was not convinced by other free themes. At the same time, I wanted to preserve the tutorial part of the blog, but not to modify another CSS file in the new version. I started playing around with Hugo, and I kinda like it. I found a lot (probably too many) themes I could choose from, and someone with a switchable dark and light theme. At that point I was sold. Moreover, I decided to be consistent with my presence online as Free2Dots, since I started streaming on Twitch and someday make some videos on Youtube. At the end of the day, I wanted a change.
