[{"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to the new iteration of my blog! “Wait, what?! Does it mean there are other versions of this thing?” I am glad you are so interested, dear reader! “Not really… But, please, continue…” In 2018 I started my first website as a way to store and present the materials for the practical lessons I was teaching at my university. I needed something pleasing for the eye, but not so fancy. I had 0 expertise in HTML and JavaScript, and paying something was not an option worth considering at that time. I resorted to the RTFM approach in the era of Internet, JFGI. One possible (free) option was to use a static site generator and to host the actual site on GitHub. There I was, using Jekyll for my static website, with some CSS custom modifications. The university course ended, and so the posting of new tutorials. No modifications since then. At the end of 2020, I decided to start publishing content there and change the theme, but it was a bit painful. I thought it was muuuuch easier! (I had to reinstall Ruby, other dependecies, fix outdated versions of some packages, etc…) So I decided to switch to HUGO and here we are.

And the writer, Victor Hugo, comes second!!! O tempora, o mores! What I actually wanted is this: a framework for building websites. It is written in Go, a language I know nothing about (as I had no clue for Jekyll written in Ruby). At the moment, the workflow for building this website with Hugo looks quite straightforward: create a new post render it with hugo serve -D if it is ok, you create the html version with hugo -t \u003cyour_theme\u003e you publish it as it is on the platform of your choice. but I will leave the details of the workflow for another post. You might ask: “Dude, that’s the same workflow for Jekyll! Stop being a fanboy!” Well, yes and no. Let’s see why.

It’s interesting, I promise!). But, for my personal site, I switched. Here the key differences I found in this short time: While installing Jekyll, I always ran into some annoyances. With Hugo, I have just installed go and hugo itself with two command lines and I am good to go (no pun intended, lol). For Jekyll I have to write a GitHub Actions to deploy the website, or something similar. For sure, you have the templates available, but if something can go wrong, it usually does. To deploy now, I just have to push the folder with the build. The remote server has to build a container, install the necessary packages and build the site. And it takes some minutes, even for small website. The changes are almost instantaneous. Of course, I found these differences once I started searching info for this new blog. “Ok, I see. But why TWO blogs?!?!” Uhm. Honestly, I did not like the theme I chose with Jekyll, and I was not convinced by other free themes. At the same time, I wanted to preserve the tutorial part of the blog, but not to modify another CSS file in the new version. I started playing around with Hugo, and I kinda like it. I found a lot (probably too many) themes I could choose from, and someone with a switchable dark and light theme. At that point I was sold. Moreover, I decided to be consistent with my presence online as Free2Dots, since I started streaming on Twitch and someday make some videos on Youtube. At the end of the day, I wanted a change. So, let’s change, then.

I have a PhD in Computational Biophysics, a fancy name to say that I used computers to investigate how proteins move and work. “What is a protein?” you may ask. Well, in a nutshell a protein is a small machine inside your body that allows you to walk, see and do everything you do. You can have a brief intro to proteins, from a computational perspective, in the QCB section. It was meant to be a practical section for a course at the University of Trento. But if you have any question, you can contact me via email ;). As far as I am concerned, I developed an interest in programming during my master’s degree, and a fortiori in my PhD years. Therefore, this is what you will find in this blog: posts about programming, mainly from a scientific perspective; posts about interesting, at least for me, books (non-fiction!); what I would like to share! Thanks for passing by, and #TanteCareCose (best wishes!). ","date":"2021-06-08","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About Free2Dots","uri":"/about/"}]
