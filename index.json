I have a PhD in Computational Biophysics, a fancy name to say that I used computers to investigate how proteins move and work. ‚ÄúWhat is a protein?‚Äù you may ask. Well, in a nutshell a protein is a small machine inside your body that allows you to walk, see and do everything you do. You can have a brief intro to proteins, from a computational perspective, in the QCB section. It was meant to be a practical section for a course at the University of Trento. But if you have any question, you can contact me via email ;). As far as I am concerned, I developed an interest in programming during my master‚Äôs degree, and a fortiori in my PhD years. Therefore, this is what you will find in this blog: posts about programming, mainly from a scientific perspective; posts about interesting, at least for me, books (non-fiction!); what I would like to share! Thanks for passing by, and #TanteCareCose (best wishes!). ","date":"2021-06-08","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About Free2Dots","uri":"/about/"}]
